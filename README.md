# Schizophrenia Classification

## Overview

This project is aimed at classifying Schizophrenia patients from healthy control patients using Electroencephalography (EEG) data. For this project, different classic and deep ML models were proposed. 

## Data

The dataset comprised 14 patients with paranoid schizophrenia and 14 healthy controls. Data were acquired with the sampling frequency of 250 Hz using the standard 10-20 EEG montage with 19 EEG channels: Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz, P4, T6, O1, O2. The reference electrode was placed between electrodes Fz and Cz.
